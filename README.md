# Big Data Group Project
**US superstore opening analysis**


As a team of 5, we uploaded an eCommerce CSV file to HDFS and utilized Apache Spark in Zeppelin to establish a connection to the data. Once the data was successfully saved to the memory, we transformed it into a Spark dataframe and used SparkSQL to find out the profitable products and exported the results on Tableau for data visualization.
